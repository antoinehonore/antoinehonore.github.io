I developed the material for 8 lectures for the pattern recognition and machine learning course ([handouts](/PRML/handouts.pdf), [latex](/PRML/latex.zip), ([slides](/PRML/slides.pdf)). 
The material is largely based on **Pattern Recognition Fundamental Theory and Exercise Problems by ARNE LEIJON and GUSTAV EJE HENTER**.
I gave the course in 2025 to master's student at KTH Royal Institute of Technology.
